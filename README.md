# frontend-school-hw1

The purpose of this homework is to learn clean code principles and code review process.

I use [JSON-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) (stub data is placed in api.json) in this project instead of required [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/premium-apis-premium-apis-default/api/tiktok33/), because it still doesn't work properly.
